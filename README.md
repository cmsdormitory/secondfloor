# 🎯 cmos.dormitory — Dormitory Points & Rewards System 

Dormitory Points & Rewards System — a lightweight platform designed for managing points, evaluations, and redemptions in dormitory or shared-living scenarios.

## <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Overview- -2563EB?style=flat-square" alt="blue"> Project Overview
cmos.dormitory turns daily dorm activities (cleaning, duty shifts, participation, infractions, etc.) into quantifiable "points" and provides a transparent, auditable process for issuing and redeeming those points. The system supports multiple roles (admin, dorm leader, member) with clear permission boundaries to make dorm self-governance and management committee operations straightforward.

## 🛠 <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Core%20Features- -7C3AED?style=flat-square" alt="purple"> Core Features
- Points management: automatic or manual awarding and deduction of points via rules for tasks, inspections, activity check-ins, and infractions.
- Redemption: members can redeem points for goods, vouchers or services (e.g., laundry pass, equipment borrowing).
- Approval and audit: configurable approval workflows for redemptions and a complete transaction log for every points change.
- Multi-role support: Admin (configure rules, manage products, approve), Dorm Leader (submit assessments, approve small redemptions), Member (view points, request redemptions).
- Notifications: notify users of points changes and redemption status via in-app notifications, email, or SMS (optional).
- Extensible catalog and rules engine to support promotions and bulk issuances.

- Event reward systems with physical / service exchange

## 🛠 Technical Highlights 
- Clear frontend / backend separation for easier development and deployment
- Configurable scoring rules to reduce the need for code changes for common ops
