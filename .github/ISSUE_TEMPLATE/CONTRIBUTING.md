# Contributing to cmos.dormitory

Thank you for considering contributing! This document explains how to contribute code, report bugs, propose features, and prepare changes for review.

1. Reporting issues
- Search existing issues before creating a new one.
- Provide a clear title and description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
- Use the repository's Issue template when opening a new issue.

2. Feature requests
- Describe the problem and the proposed solution or behavior.
- Explain who benefits and provide UI/UX sketches if helpful.
- Be open to discussion — maintainers may suggest alternatives.

3. Development workflow
- Fork the repository and create a branch named using the pattern: type/short-description (e.g., feat/add-redeem-flow or fix/checkout-bug).
- Keep changes focused and atomic: one feature or bug fix per branch/PR.
- Rebase or merge from mainline frequently to minimize conflicts.

4. Coding standards
- Follow existing project style and conventions.
- Use linting and formatting tools if present (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
- Write meaningful commit messages. Use present-tense, short summary and more details in the body if necessary.

5. Tests
- Add or update unit/integration tests for your changes where applicable.
- Ensure tests pass locally before opening a PR.

6. Pull Request process
- Open a PR against the repository's main branch.
- Describe what the PR does, why, and any noteworthy implementation details.
- Link the issue it addresses (if any).
- Address review comments and keep the PR up-to-date.

7. Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and collaborative. By participating, you agree to follow the project's Code of Conduct (add or reference one if you have it).

If you need help getting started, open an issue with the label "help wanted" or contact the maintainers.
